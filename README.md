# Markdown Previewer 
The second project from the Front End Development Libraries Cert in the [Free Code Camp Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). This is a Markdown Previewer where Markdown can be entered in a textbox and then rendered to a display next to it to see what it'll look like in advance. Uses React and the [Marked Package.](https://marked.js.org/)
